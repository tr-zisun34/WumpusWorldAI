# Wumpus World AI Simulation  

## Overview  
This project simulates a logical AI agent navigating a 10x10 Wumpus World, enhancing understanding of logical representation and inference.  

## Features  
- **Logic & Inference**: Utilizes Propositional/First-Order Logic, resolution, forward/backward chaining, and probabilistic reasoning.  
- **Environment**: Supports random and pre-defined environments via file input.  
- **Agent Capabilities**:  
  - Intelligent decision-making  
  - Infinite loop detection and avoidance  

## Interface  
- Visualizes environment and the agent's logical thought process, including its knowledge base.  

Developed by **BanglaReboot** for **CSE604 AI Project 2**.
